# aspcore-uploader-webservices

This repository explains how to manage the upload process on the server. The upload process requires a save and remove action URL. The save action handler uploads the files that need to be specified in the saveUrl property. The save handler receives the submitted files and manages the save process on the server. The remove action is optional. Specify the URL to handle the remove process from the server. The remove handler receives the posted files and handles the remove operation on the server.
